		<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
		<h3>Michael</h3>
		<p>would to work under Network Security, Network + Systems Administration, Web Development or a Systems Analysts. 
		These job ambitions are extremely broad, and would indicate that I’m more than happy to learn new skills and adapt in new situations</p>
		
		<h3>Ben</h3>
		<p>My ideal job would be to work as a systems administrator or a business analyst because I am very good with statistics and analysing data in order to get a result. 
		This will also mean that I am able to delegate roles to people which is another one of my strengths. </p>
		
		<h3>Matthew</h3>
		<p>An ideal job for me would be a job relating to the IT field, and would probably have something to do with managing/programming websites or being an onsite tech support. 
		I’m not too fussed with what I do as a job and I’d be more than happy to do whatever in the IT industry so long as it has decent pay and hours. </p>
		
		<h3>Kartik</h3>
		<p>My ideal job is to work in Networking or marketing side. I would also enjoy working in esports, as an analyst, player etc. 
		These jobs are unpredictable and you don’t really know what to expect and therefore it interests me as it won’t be the same thing over and over again. 
		Along with that it allows me to learn new things, build on skills I already have and also learn to better adapt in unpredictable situations. 
		This will therefore go into helping improve my problem solving skills </p>
		
		<h3>Jack</h3>
		<p>My ideal job would be to work as a Cyber Security Analyst or as a System Analyst. 
		As these jobs have various aspects surrounding them, there are many concepts and ideas that I will have to learn during my time at University. 
		Even after university I will be continuously learning things in this field as it is ever changing and I would be more than glad to do so, and this will also improve on my ability to solve problems. </p>
		
		<h2>Ideal Job comparison</h2>
		<p>We seem to have very similar career paths.
		Two of our group members wanted to be systems analyst. 
		This shows that we both enjoy doing the same thing and will be viaing for the same or similar jobs in the future.</p>
		
		<h2>How well did group work?</h2>
		
		<h2>Career Plans</h2>
		<p>Within the group there are various similarities in regards to which careers we are pursuing. 
		The most common element is that most of the group members want to be an IT analyst in some field. 
		This could either be a System Analyst which the interest is shared between Jack and Michael, 
		Networking or a business analyst and this field is common between Kartik and Ben. Majority of the members ideas are broad as they’ve indicated that they would gladly learn new skills, 
		adapt and work to their specific strengths. </p>

		<p>There are however a few differences between a few members, some members prefer the more business/marketing side of IT as these members are more suited to statistics as well as working 
		with data, and others want to deal with the Networking/Security/Administration side of IT, due to their knowledge with computer hardware and interest in computer systems. </p>

		<p>Overall the career plans between each member is similar, as each member is aiming to achieve a job in the IT industry. However, Ben and Kartik have expressed interest in the 
		business part of IT which separates their career plans from the others as they may need another qualification.
		Jack and Michael have shown that their career plans of System analyst are similar while Matthew has expressed his passion in the programming side of IT. </p>
