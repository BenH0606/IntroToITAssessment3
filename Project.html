			<h2>Aims</h2>
			<p> The project idea that we’ve all selected is Michael Tsihlakis’ idea of creating a robotic device that is capable of cleaning, 
			cooking and fixing around a users’ house. This robot can verbally spoken to, as well as messaged via Android or iPhone. The physical device is slim, with an adjustable height, 
			four arms and a single wheel, only weighing 50 kgs, being extremely quiet. The robot can be purchased in different colours ranging from pure white, pink, grey, dark blue, black. </p>
			
			<p>This creation can also alter their voices, from female to male, vice versa, at any given time. 
			The device is capable of reading and understanding multiple different languages, verbal and non-verbal methods, 
			in a Siri-like way, with responses that will allow the robot to accurately execute their goal. When with heavily circled or messy handwriting,
			the robot will still understand what the users want and need from them. </p>
			
			<p>The application will be connected to the robot will allow users to communicate with the robot from any destination, 
			and enable the user to give a requests on what needs to be accomplished around the house. 
			This allows the user multiple options for communication, as calling and/or texting are methods that 
			can be used the engage and discuss about the mission that’s needed to be complete. A schedule as also been added to the application, 
			which lets users plan out what is wanted from the robot throughout the week, i.e. “Clean House” - 2PM (Later that day) “Cook Food/Pasta” - 
			5PM, without the user needing to repeat themselves. The activities such as “Cleaning”, “Cooking” and “Fixing”, may be broad but it’s capable of
			accomplishing all these goals to the fullest. </p>
			
			</p>This ritual will save time from any user and help allow the robot know what to do always at this given time, 
			thus letting the user have some time on their own to do their needs. The robot can fix broken equipment, given that the equipment to fix it is also there, 
			i.e. a light bulb has burnt out and is needed to be replaced. Even with this device, it can create and build around the house as well, given that blueprints or 
			some form of description is shown. Cooking is also be a hassle for users to do after coming home from a long day at work. Allowing the robot to complete that chore is also a relief, 
			with only needing to submit a receipt, and allow the robot complete it. Same with cleaning, which is a massive hassle for users to do after finding no time for themselves. 
			They are capable of cleaning nearly anything that is requested to them, but with the required equipment to do so. This can even includes very small spaces that can be cleaned up. 
			The reason for this creation is to make users lives’ easily, by eliminating any form of chore. Users will find that it’ll save money and will deliver the best fixing skills,
			best dishes for yourself and visitors, and repeating demonstrate how the house can always be clean. This is a great and easy design, for all 
			people from different cultures, ages and experiences, that can appreciate. Showing that their can be no barriers and save time and money from users, will be 
			beneficial for all of us in the greater future.  </p>
		
			<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
			<p>Before Week 1: Ben started around a week earlier and has completed a fair amount of work (as much as he could do by himself with no one really around). 
			After completing the Aim and a brief description for few of subheadings. </p>
			
			<p>Week 1: *Jack and Kartik were present*: Created a checklist with a legend making it easier to see what we have done and what needs to be done. 
			Checked off what has been done by Ben. Aims hasn’t been touched as we think it doesn’t really require much more, however we have added the subheadings that were 
			left out such as “plans and progress”, “tools and technologies”, “skills and jobs”, “feedback”, “group reflection”. Along with that we began working on the “plans and progress”, 
			there was more information and depth added to “roles”. “Scopes and limits” was also heavily edited and added to as it needed more information on both, 
			the limits and scope and also needed more information about our scope in the actual working period (6 weeks) and the hypothetical 16 week. 
			Tools and technologies was briefly added to as it didn’t need much and everything else was added to as well. The problem we faced was 
			just having Jack and I here as it was hard to confirm anything as most people were sick.
</p>
			<p>Week 2: We discuss the overall needs of the assignment, and become placed under our categories. Ben and Jack will collectively create and form the application of the robot. 
			Using Atom, AWS, and Programmers Notepad. These programs have been chosen as they are easy to use and we have experience so it will be easier for us to be able to create our product.   
			Matthew and Kartik are assorted to Technical Developer areas, where they will being using physical parts, a different programming application called “Edison” to execute the needs. 
			Michael has been designated to Lead Developer, which will allow him to alternate from UI Designer or Technical Developer, and assist in creating the robot. The Lead Developer 
			paths the way for other peers in create this device, and makes sure all areas are ticked correctly. </p>
			
			<p>Week 3: Work on our individual sections in order to make sure that we are able to make the best product as possible. Ben and Jack are working hard together 
			in order to make sure that the product works from a UI perspective, while Matthew and Kartik are working on the programming aspects of our project. 
			Whilst we are doing this, Michael is overseeing everything as it was his idea for the project that we are creating. </p>
			
			<p>Week 4: Continue to work on individual sections in order to make sure that we are able to make the best product as possible. 
			Ben and Jack are working hard together in order to make sure that the product works from a UI perspective, while Matthew 
			and Kartik are working on the programming aspects of our project. Whilst we are doing this, Michael is overseeing 
			everything as it was his idea for the project that we are creating. </p>

			<p>Week 5: We continue on our progress, analysing all these to ensure we are correcting our executes and objectives. 
			Making sure we communicate our needs and desire, and ensure we have weekly meetings. </p>

			<p>Week 6: We organise a meeting and discuss each of our sections in order to make sure we’re on the correct path. 
			We discuss within the meeting the progress each individual as achieved, and what other things we need to consider whilst creating the objective. </p>
			
			<p>Week 7: Continue to discuss our sections and make sure that all of the notes are clear and concise in order to make sure that we are able 
			to make changes that are required to make the project the best it can be. Michael will be the head person and will be the head of the 
			discussions as he is the lead person in this project so he will be the one who will be ending up making the key decisions in the end. </p>
			
			<p>Week 8: Go through and start editing the sections based on the feedback from weeks 6 and 7. We need to make sure that we are clear 
			about the editiations that we are making and we think about the purpose of what we are creating. Michael will be the head person and 
			will be the head of the discussions as he is the lead person in this project so he will be the one who will be ending up making the key decisions in the end. </p>
			
			<p>Week 9: Continue to work through the editations as per week 8. Make sure that the editations made are for a purpose. Michael will be the head person 
			and will be the head of the discussions as he is the lead person in this project so he will be the one who will be ending up making the key decisions in the end. </p>
			
			<p>Week 10: Continue to work through the editations as per week 8. Make sure that the editations made are for a purpose. Michael will be the head person 
			and will be the head of the discussions as he is the lead person in this project so he will be the one who will be ending up making the key decisions in the end. </p>
			
			<p>Week 11: We all collectively touched-up all areas of the assignment and finally began our PowerPoint slides. Members in the group will be assigned to create 
			notes for the slides and we will orderly perform then in our own time. This will allow us to prepare for the presentation by having us make sure that we are 
			able to go through and each say something that we know about, rather than just saying something because we must.  </p>
			
			<p>Week 12: Look at getting feedback in order to make sure that we know what is going well and what is not going well. After this, we can go through 
			and start making changes in order to make the product better, based on the feedback that we have received.  </p>
			
			<p>
			Week 13:  go through and start making changes in order to make the product better, based on the feedback that we have received. This will be mainly done by the 
			UI designers, Ben and Jack. They will have to go through and test the product as if they are users in order to make sure that the product will not be too 
			hard for users to use, because if it is then people will end up not wanting to use there product and will just go to someone else.</p>
			
			<p>Week 14: go through and test the product that we have made to make sure that it is doing what it should do. This will be mainly done by the UI designers, Ben and Jack. 
			They will have to go through and test the product as if they are users in order to make sure that the product will not be too hard for users to use, because 
			if it is then people will end up not wanting to use there product and will just go to someone else. </p>
			
			<p>Week 15: Continue the testing from week 14 and make sure that the product is going to be as easy to use as possible. This will be mainly done by the UI 
			designers, Ben and Jack. They will have to go through and test the product as if they are users in order to make sure that the product will not be too hard
			for users to use, because if it is then people will end up not wanting to use there product and will just go to someone else. </p>
			
			<p>Week 16: Complete all of the work that needs to be completed and then submit the work.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2>Roles</h2>
			<p>In our group we shall have the following roles. 
			<li>Ben:  UI designer</li>
			<li>Jack: UI designer</li>
			<li>Kartik: Technical Developer </li>
			<li>Matthew: Technical Developer</li>
			<li>Michael: Lead Developer</li>
			<br>
			The group roles have been assorted this way in order to maximise efficiency and play on the strengths and weaknesses of each member. 
			If a member who was efficient in UI design was put into Lead Developer, this would not lead to efficient development of the project. 
			Jack and Ben were placed as UI Designers as this best suits their proficiencies, similarly Kartik and Matthew have been placed as 
			'Technical Developers due to their strength in creativity and strong interpersonal communication skills.
			Michael has been chosen as the Lead Developer due his leadership skills and programming skills, he’ll be able to ensure that 
			everyone is functioning at their best. </p>
		
			<h2>Scope</h2>
			<p>In terms of the scope in relation to our project, we are trying to make it so that we are able
			to have the basis of the robot who helps us to do things. This allows us to be able to go through and see people getting assistance. 
			This means that we will be able to have a plan/layout of what the robot is intended In terms of its limits, as we do have a limited time frame. 
			We have a 6 week period in which to complete the assessment. Till week 6, our scope is to have done the basic coding for the robot, 
			things like greeting and basic movement it might do. We should also be able to get a rough visual representation of what we want the robot to look like. 
			In order to get around this we need to make sure that we have a good amount of planning that gets done in the beginning of the project so that we are 
			able to get a good result out in the end. One thing for sure is that we won’t have enough time, resources and experience to actually make the robot so 
			that puts a big limitation on us and the project. Some other limits that may present themselves later would be in the actual programming we attempt to do 
			(programming that go into the hypothetical robot). The proper level of programming knowledge required is way beyond our current level so therefore there 
			is a limit to our knowledge as well. Another potential limit during the final stages of the assignment would be the final group feedback because we plan 
			to keep our roles for the most part so it would be difficult to specifically determine how well everyone did without using some amount of guessing.

 </p>
			
			<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
			<p>We will need google docs to get all the information and plan ready for everyone to see easily. 
			We will need programmers notepad for the programming. We also need basic things like Word and a PC. 
			Most of our past experience is with GitHub and we have ample experience with everything else listed here. 
			The reason we are using Notepad is because Ben uses it, and he is the one that does most of the programming and 
			therefore we will be using that. Ben has more knowledge in the notepad compared to GitHub. We also use messenger for communication. </p>
			
			<p>12 sensors similar to the Xiaomi robot vacuum which maps out the whole house. This ensures that the robot is accustomed to the environment 
			around it and doesn’t just bump around everywhere. Uses laser scanning for the map recreation of the house and maps it onto the app
			App allows user to label areas of interest meaning you can label where the dishwasher is, where the washing machine is or other less significant 
			things like the dog bowl are. Solar panels on the back of the “head”. Rubber based wheels so it is silent when moving around. 
			And the “fingers” are also coated in rubber to remove the chance of scratches and other breakages on things such as glassware.
			Edges coated in collision-avoidance rubber make sure there is no damage to the robot or the walls the environment. Cliff sensor makes sure it doesn’t fall. 
			The robot is also integrated with a gyroscope which allows it to stand on its one wheel and not be off balance. LDS cover bumper allows the robot to 
			not get stuck and the dual electronic compasses allows it to better map the walls around it. Uses bluetooth v5.0 and wifi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac 2.4G+5GHz 
			to connect to smartphone which then enables the usage of the robot. IP68 water and dust resistance which makes sure that when the dust settles over 
			night it doesn’t make the robot malfunction along with protection against the water splashing on the robot during things like washing the dishes. 
			A list of all sensors it uses are; accelerometer, gyro sensor, hall sensor and proximity sensor. 
			The physical estimation are from 165cms to 178cms as it has an adjustable height and it weighs approximately 50kg. For hardware specifications.</p>
			
			<h2>Testing</h2>
			<p>In order to test our product we will go to the users and see how they use the product, this will be done in a controlled environment 
			through collecting a sample of the population and using them as the basis for data collection. This is important because this is a good
			way to see if everything works as you believe it should, or if there are some errors that you believe need to be fixed before the product 
			goes into being distributed to the public, furthermore getting the user feedback is crucial. It is important that this covers a wide demographic of
			people as otherwise you may get people who have a lot of technical experience and this may not allow you to be able to get a good idea of what 
			works well and what does not work well in your product.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, as this product is heavily programming centred, a lot of testing, debugging and error correction will need to go into this product 
			before it is even prototyped. If there are errors or bugs within the code, the program built into the product prototype may not even function, 
			if this is the case then the code may need to be completed from scratch.

			<h2>Risks</h2>
			<p>In terms of risks there are a number of different issues that come from the production of products like ours. 
			One of the key risks is the fact that people may not be able to program that well. This is an issue because people 
			may not be able to write the program correctly because they may not have had the required experience 
			that would come from having already worked in the IT industry as a programmer. This is due to most members not 
			having fully completed their course yet, their knowledge will be extremely limited. </p>

			<p>Another risk is that the program will not work properly. This can be due to a number of problems that the people who develop the program may not be able to fix. 
			The members won’t have the experience to be able to fully implement the program, as it is a robot we’re working with we don’t have the knowledge to fully program 
			the robot to do various actions. </p>
			
			<h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
			<p>In terms of communication, our group has used facebook as our main source of communication. This is good because it allows us to be able to each 
			see what each other is saying and also be able to refer to it later on when we get to writing a part of our project, or reading another person's work. 
			It also allows us to be able to see what is working and also we can hold people accountable if they are saying that they will end up getting a piece 
			of work done by a certain point and they do not do that. </p>
			
			<h2>Skills and Jobs</h2>
			<p>The first person I would employ is a developer so that the robot will continue to work as well as it should. The second person I would employ 
			is a usability expert to make sure it is good for people in the community. The third person is a programmer so that they can help with programming 
			the robot in order to make it work. Finally, I would employ a lead developer as it is there project idea and they can give information as to what they want.
